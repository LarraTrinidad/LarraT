A Four-joined gradient and formation of Fat-Dachsous Heterodimers

This repository contains source files the models implemented in my thesis.

The simulations can be ran by first installing Chaste (https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/documentation.html) on your machine and clone this repository.

The code in /test called "TestFtDsSimulations.hpp" is an implementation of the Hale et al., (2015) model (https://elifesciences.org/articles/05789) in 2D using Chaste

Two tests are ran in this code:
1) static
2) with cell divisions

The simulations can then be visualised using Paraview (https://www.paraview.org/)
