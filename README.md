Codes used in thesis

The following codes were written in RStudio (https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

/Cell division rose plots : contains an 'Individual Analysis.Rmd' file that can plot the cell division data written on 'Angles_Division.csv'. To combine data from multiple samples, run the code 'Combined.Rmd'. To run Kolgomorov-Smirnov tests between genotypes, input all the data on 'KS_Test.csv' and run the 'Average_SD' file.

/Cell elongation polar histograms : contains contains an 'Individual Analysis.Rmd' file that can plot the cell elongation data written on 'Angles_orientation.csv'. To run Kolgomorov-Smirnov tests between genotypes, input all the data on 'KS_Test.csv' and run the 'Average_SD' file.

/Circular laser ablations : contains two R codes -  one can plot the invidiual sample's recoil velocities ('Individual laser ablation') and another that can plot the average across samples 'Averaged laser ablation'

/One-phase exponential FRAP : contains an 'One-phase exponential.Rmd' code that can fit a one-phase exponential line to your FRAP data held in 'Individual wing'. Two output .csv files will be generated one you analyse all your samples. You can combine the samples (per genotype) using the 'One-phase Combined Plots.Rmd'.

/Polarity polar histograms : contains contains an 'Individual Analysis.Rmd' file that can plot the cell elongation data written on 'Angles_Polarity.csv'. To run Kolgomorov-Smirnov tests between genotypes, input all the data on 'KS_Test.csv' and run the 'Average_SD' file.

/T1 transitions rose plots : contains contains a 'T1 Individual Analysis.Rmd' file that can plot the T1 transition orientation data written on 'Angles_T1.csv'.
